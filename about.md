###DESCRIPTION
This course will introduce the key concepts of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and illustrate how GIS data may be employed in population health research. The course will be comprised of daily lectures and lab sessions. The lectures will feature presentations of basic GIS concepts, GIS data and analysis, how to leverage GIS data to model spatial health-related phenomena, data mining, and how to use GIS output data. The lab sessions will allow course attendees to work hands-on with ESRI’s ArcGIS software package, QGIS, and other GIS tools during lab exercises using spatial data, geocoding, preparing data for analysis, geoprocessing and mapping of public health data

###INSTRUCTOR
Daniel M. Sheehan

###OBJECTIVES
By the end of the course, participants will be able to:

* Understand the basics of using ArcGIS software
* Demonstrate processing techniques appropriate to spatial data
* Design and create map output in both static and dynamic form
* Discuss the capabilities of GIS and spatial analysis as they relate to the attendees’ particular research interests

###PREREQUISITES
Basic understanding of computer file structure and directory paths. For students with administrative rights over a laptop, they may choose to install the latest version of QGIS (http://www.qgis.org/) prior to the course. Or since the installation has many dependencies and differs by OS, students may wish to install the software on the first day of class. They may also choose (if they have Windows or a Mac (dual-boot, Parallels, Fusion)) to install a 1 - year student version of ArcGIS (http://www.esri.com/landing-pages/software/arcgis/arcgis-desktop-student...). 

###RECOMMENDED READINGS
Additional PDF optional GIS readings will be supplied to the students by the instructor. In the meantime, these web-resources are useful:
